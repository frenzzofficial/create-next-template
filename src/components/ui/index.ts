// NOTE: LucideIcon is intentionally NOT re-exported here. It directly
// imports "server-only", and this barrel is also imported by Client
// Components (app/error.tsx, app/dev/design-system). Re-exporting a
// server-only module from a barrel a Client Component imports breaks
// the build for every consumer of that barrel, not just the one that
// actually needed the server-only piece. Import it directly instead:
// "@/components/ui/images/LucideIcon" — safe from a Server Component.
//
// NavigationLogo used to be excluded here too (it read appConfig, which
// used to import the server-only app.env.ts) — that's fixed now:
// app.configs.ts sources from the client-safe client.env.ts instead,
// since none of appConfig's fields actually needed the server-only
// portion. See the note in packages/configs/app.configs.ts.
